# emma_ch1_metrics: example nltk-narrative-metrics

Small learning exercise inspired by *Natural Language Processing with Python* (Bird, Klein, Loper).  
Demonstrates tokenization, POS tagging, and a few simple narrative-adjacent metrics on a **public-domain** text.

- A minimal NLTK script that:
  - tokenizes sentences/words
  - POS-tags tokens
  - reports counts (verbs, adverbs, nouns, adjectives)
  - basic frequency + readability-ish numbers
