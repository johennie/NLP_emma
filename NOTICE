This product includes software developed as part of the 
emma_ch1_metrics project.

emma_ch1_metrics is a learning exercise inspired by 
"Natural Language Processing with Python" (Bird, Klein, Loper).
It uses NLTK's built-in Gutenberg corpus (austen-emma.txt) 
to compute simple per-sentence metrics for Jane Austen's *Emma* (Chapter I).
